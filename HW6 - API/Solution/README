## Weather Relative to the Equator Analysis
1. The closer the points are to the equator, the higher the temperature.  And vise versa, the farther away the point is from the equator, the colder the temperature.
2. Data set is too small to determine the relationship between humidity and latitude.
3. Based on the small data set, the proximity to the equator does not seem to determine the increase or decrease in cloudiness.
4. Again, based on the small data set and reviewing the wind speed vs. altitude scatter plot that thereâ€™s less wind near the equator and more as one goes further out.
